          a writer whose least favorite section to write is the About Me blurb,
          but here we are! <br />
          As a creative entrepreneur, Iâ€™ve developed, grown and launched
          lifestyle brands with unique and compelling copy for over 15 years. My
          experience as a ghostwriter began in college, writing and editing my
          friends' papers so they could stress less and have more fun. That's
          exactly what I want to do for YOU; give you more time to focus on what
          brings you fulfillment, success and peace of mind. Whether youâ€™re a
          creative entrepreneur or someone suffering from writerâ€™s block blues,
          I got you!
        </p>

        <p className="modal__text">
          My writing spans more genres than there are numbers on a roulette
          wheel (but I promise, everyone wins). Nothing makes me happier than
          getting positive feedback from my clients! I truly find pleasure in
          helping others find their voice through the written word. Everyone has
          a story (or twoðŸ˜‰). Letâ€™s tell yours!
        </p>
        <p className="modal__text">
          When I'm not leisurely looking up word origins, I'm a ride-or-die NYC
          girl, a beginner surfer, a former matchmaker and everyoneâ€™s pro-bono
          therapist. If you think weâ€™re a good fit, letâ€™s work together! Iâ€™m
          excited to hear from you!
        </p>
